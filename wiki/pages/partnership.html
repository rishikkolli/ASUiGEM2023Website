        <div class="description_one">
          <p>The iGEM Phototroph Community was conceptualized and founded by iGEM teams Marburg (overgrad grand prize
            winners ‘21) and Bielefeld (top 10 rank ‘21) in 2021. Both teams were some of the few that chose to work
            with plants. Their vision was to provide iGEM teams working with phototrophic chassis – microalgae,
            cyanobacteria, and higher plants – a space to connect to one another, speak with experts in the field to get
            advice and troubleshoot their projects, and to create resources that would be valuable for iGEM teams
            wanting to work with phototrophs in the years ahead. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="description_one">
          <p>Phototrophic organisms are an unpopular chassis to work with in the iGEM competition because they grow
            slowly compared to bacterial species and require specialized protocols for cloning and transformation, many
            of which have yet to be standardized in the literature. In order to make it easier for teams to work with
            phototrophs, the iGEM Phototroph Community has been dedicated to creating a standardized set of protocols
            that is annually reviewed and expanded upon in the form of the Phototroph Community handbook. The first
            edition of the handbook, written in 2021, was 160 pages long and included contributions from 11 iGEM teams
            (including ASU iGEM 2021) from around the world. </p>

        <div class="description_second">
          <p>Due to Bielefeld and Marburg’s choice to not participate in the 2022 competition cycle, there was a clear
            need for iGEM teams to maintain the community. Because of ASU iGEM’s involvement in the community in 2021,
            we were aware of the community and the great opportunity it presented to teams to collaborate and gain
            useful insight into their projects.</p>

          <p>Our connection to the community in 2022 began when we spoke with Finn Wieland, an iGEM Marburg 2021 team
            member and one of the administrators of Biocord, the largest Discord server for bio-enthusiasts to date.
            Finn mentioned that the UBCO team was interested in reviving the Phototroph community for the 2022
            competition cycle, and suggested that we work with them to spearhead the community and host an event on
            Biocord. After meeting with the UBCO team, we set up our goals for what we wanted to accomplish with the
            community this year, and thus began a close partnership that would last throughout the competition season.

        <div class="description_second">
          <p>The plan for the 2022 Phototroph Community was to 1) revive the Slack workspace by inviting new teams and
            experts to join and discuss their projects, 2) host 2 meetups over the summer for teams to present their
            project pitches and get some troubleshooting help from experts, 3) host a final conference for industry and
            academic professionals to discuss their research and for iGEM teams to get feedback on their project
            presentations from those professionals.</p>

          <p>Our first online meetup was hosted on July 30, 2022. Cedric Brinkmann (iGEM Marburg 2021) started off the
            event by detailing a brief history of the Phototroph community and an overview of OpenPlast, iGEM Marburg’s
            project from 2021. We also had René Inckemann (iGEM Marburg Instructor 2021) from the iGEM Plant SynBio
            Subcommittee talk about how the group can support teams working with phototrophic chassis. René also led a
            group discussion to get feedback from teams on what other services the Plant Subcommittee can provide.
            Afterwards, the teams in attendance gave 5-7 minute project pitches, followed by Q&A sessions to answer
            questions from other attendees. Lastly, we had another group discussion to determine which teams were
            interested in contributing to this large-scale handbook and video protocol collaboration, and what those
            contributions would look like</p>

          <p> <br> The second online meetup happened on August 20, 2022, and was designed to be a troubleshooting event
            where teams could get specific advice related to their needs. This event was scheduled to be in late August,
            as this is often the point in the competition where teams begin to face issues in getting expected lab
            results. The event began with introductory talks from guest speakers Dr. Luis De Stefano (UPCH, Plant
            specialist) and Dr. Mitra Tabatabaee (UBCO), who gave inspiring talks on how to deal with various roadblocks
            in research and strategies to overcome them. We also had guest experts to assist with more specific issues:
            Dr. Everett Eustance (ASU, Algae specialist) and Santiago Ochoa (ASU, Cloning specialist). These experts
            provided feedback to teams in troubleshooting breakout sessions. After the troubleshooting session, we
            regrouped to discuss the guidelines and deadlines associated with the handbook and video protocol additions.

          <p>Our final event, the Phototroph Community Virtual Conference, was held on August 27, 2022. While the actual
            conference was held over Zoom, we collaborated with Biocord to stream this event on their platform as well
            for non-iGEMers to watch. The special event featured talks from experts in academia and industry
            specializing in synthetic biology with plants, microalgae, cyanobacteria and more! Guest speakers included
            Dr. Jake Wintermute (Ginkgo Bioworks), Dr. Moritz Koch (BASF), and Dr. Henrik Toft Simonsen (DTU). After the
            series of guest talks, attending iGEM teams had the chance to showcase their 2022 projects to our speakers
            in order to receive feedback on their work and prepare for their presentations at the Grand Jamboree. Over
            the course of the five-hour event, we hosted a total of almost 60 attendees from Biocord and Zoom.

          <p>Alongside the personal benefits that teams saw from being part of the Phototroph Community, they also had
            the chance to give back by preparing protocols and other informational chapters for future teams to learn
            from. These contributions came in the form of written chapters, that were integrated directly into the
            existing written handbook, as well as in videos, which are available for viewing on the community’s YouTube
            page, and are linked within online copies of the handbook as well. </p>

          <p>The Phototroph Community Handbook is an incredibly valuable resource for teams because it is a living
            document of background information, protocols, and experimental procedures compiled from iGEM teams all over
            the world. In 2022, 8 teams helped contribute to volume II of the handbook, adding a total of almost 40
            pages worth of information to the initial document created in 2021. These contributions expanded on the
            cultivation of cyanobacteria and plants, the transformation of microalgae and higher plants, the evolution
            of phototrophic organisms and other novel cloning methods, including Golden Braid 2.0.</p>

          <p>In 2021, iGEM Marburg and iGEM Bielefeld created the Phototroph Badges as a means of recognizing the
            efforts made by Phototroph teams and having their contributions easily visible on their Wiki pages. For the
            2022 season, UBCO and ASU re-designed these four badges to reflect the contributions made by the teams, as
            well as to be more inclusive for teams working with non-plant phototrophs.</p>

          <p>The four badges we distributed this year are the Community, Presentation, Handbook and Organization badges.
            The Community badge was earned by joining the Phototroph Community workspace on Slack. The Presentation
            badge was earned by teams who presented their project at the Virtual Conference. The Handbook badge was
            earned by the teams who helped write the Phototroph Handbook, passing on their knowledge and experience to
            future iGEM teams. The Organization badge is exclusive to ASU iGEM and UBCO iGEM for leading the community,
            planning the meetups and conference, managing the Slack workspace, and compiling additions to the community

          <p>In 2022, ASU and UBCO were able to successfully expand on the initial efforts of the Phototroph Community
            put forth by Marburg and Bielefeld. For the 2023 competition, we plan to pass on leadership of the community
            to two more phototroph teams to ensure that this space is maintained for future iGEMers to benefit from.</p>

          <p>We hope that our work this year – hosting events, maintaining an active discourse via Slack, and writing
            the second volume of the Phototroph Community Handbook – give future iGEM teams the ability to choose to
            work with phototrophic chassis without fear of feeling unsupported or lost during the competition cycle. We
            plan to remain active on the Phototroph Community Slack workspace as needed to provide insight and advice!
            We also plan to have volume II of the community handbook posted on the iGEM Plant Subcommittee’s website to

          <p>Our partnership with QGEM (team Queens_Canada) began early in the competition cycle when we connected with
            them over Slack after noticing that both of our teams were dedicated to solving water quality issues in
            rural and indigenous communities. Because our projects attempted to tackle that issue in vastly different
            ways, there unfortunately wasn’t much room for a productive wet lab collaboration between our teams.
            However, we both shared interest in science communication and educating the public about the water
            contamination issues that often go unnoticed in these communities. </p>

            unfortunately unable to communicate directly with this portion of our target population due to existing
            institutional restrictions on who can interface with indigenous groups. Because we could not speak to those
            who live in the communities impacted by water contamination, we decided to create a podcast where we could
            discuss the science behind bioremediation for a larger public audience to educate them on water quality
            issues.</p>

          <p>Interviewing Process</p>
        </div>
        <div class="description_one">
          <p>We decided to reach out to academic professionals in synthetic biology, metabolic engineering, water
            quality processing, and bioethics in order to present a comprehensive set of information to our listeners.
            Our first interview was with Dr. Stephen Brown of Queen’s University, whose research concerns organic
            particle detection in water sources through specifically-designed instruments and biochemical assays. We
            wanted to speak with Dr. Brown because his experience in water sample analysis and decontamination
            strategies was particularly relevant to our topic, and his answers to our questions were incredibly
            insightful!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="description_one">
          <p>We also had the chance to speak to Dr. Arul Varman, a professor at ASU’s chemical engineering department
            who works on engineering microorganisms to sustainably produce chemicals and biofuels. Though Dr. Varman’s
            research is not directly related to bioremediation, his work heavily involves metabolic engineering and
            synbio. His ability to explain how and why organisms are engineered to gain new functions alongside
            potential solutions these organisms can provide was very valuable to us.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="description_one">
          <p>Another one of the guests we were able to speak with was Dr. Rosa Krajmalnik-Brown (who also goes by Dr.
            Rosy), a professor in civil and environmental engineering at ASU. Dr. Rosy’s research encompasses many
            topics, but we spoke to her to gain a better understanding of her research in the biodegradation of water
            contaminants and her approach towards using synbio vs. traditional environmental engineering techniques to
            solve problems. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="description_one">
          <p>Our final guest on the podcast was Dr. Lalitha Sundaram, a research associate at Cambridge University
            whose work focuses on the concept of biological risk – that is, assessing the potential risks that
            accompany new and emerging biotechnologies. While her perspectives on bioethics were especially important
            in our discussions of synbio and bioremediation, Dr. Sundaram had also worked on a project with the
            University of Cambridge and Edinburgh to develop a novel arsenic biosensor for people living in regions
            with contaminated water sources to test their water quality before consumption. This was extremely
            relevant to our own iGEM project this year, and we were happy to hear more details of her endeavors during
            the interview.

          <p>The interviews conducted with Dr. Brown, Dr. Varman, Dr. Rosy, and Dr. Sundaram were compiled and organized into a series of episodes that discuss a myriad of topics, ranging from how organisms are engineered to the bioethical considerations of bioremediation and everything in between.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="description_one">
          <p>The episodes each provide a unique perspective into a different aspect of water bioremediation, allowing listeners to fully understand how synbio can be used as a powerful means of solving water quality issues.
          </p>

          <p>
            We hope that this introduction serves as a resource that sparks interest in listeners with little science background, and inspires future iGEMers to take on the challenge of working on projects related to bioremediation.
